### Challenge

> * Create the project BankAccount that will receive data via terminal commands
> * Inside the project, create the TerminalAccount.java class
> * You will have to allow the user to insert the data via the terminal to answer dialog questions to interact with the system
> * After successful interaction, the bank account will be created
> * The system shall return the following message to the user: _"Welcome [Account Holder]! Thank you for opening an account at our bank. Your branch is [Acct Branch], your account is [Acct Number] and your balance is [Acct Balance], which is already available for withdrawals."_
> * Other interactions will be coded in case the user wants to do something else besides create a new account.
